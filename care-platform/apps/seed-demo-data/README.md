# seed-demo-data

A Cucumber-driven seed data app for the clinic-fhir-system, written in TypeScript. It populates the local development stack with five realistic patient profiles — each with encounters and vitals spread over the past ~45 days — so the clinician UI always has meaningful, recent data to render.

---

## Why this exists

The original seed data consisted of large Synthea-generated FHIR bundles posted directly to HAPI FHIR. Those bundles:

- Had hardcoded absolute dates that aged out quickly
- Were opaque — hard to read, impossible to tweak without regenerating
- Included hundreds of irrelevant FHIR resource types (conditions, medications, imaging, etc.)

This app replaces that with **Gherkin feature files** that describe exactly what data exists and why. Every run recalculates dates relative to today, so the UI always sees fresh, in-range readings.

---

## How it works

```
patients.feature  (Gherkin scenarios with data tables)
       ↓
Step definitions  (TypeScript — background, patient, encounter, vitals)
       ↓
api-client.ts     (typed fetch wrappers)
       ↓
HAPI FHIR direct (port 8080)  →  Practitioner, Organization, Patient (PUT with fixed ID)
Spring Boot API  (port 9090)  →  Encounter, Vitals (POST — HAPI assigns UUID)
```

Each Cucumber `Scenario` is one patient. Before creating a patient, the step cascade-deletes all existing observations and encounters for that patient's fixed ID, then PUTs the patient resource directly to HAPI FHIR — ensuring the same ID is used on every run. Encounters and vitals are created through the Spring Boot API as usual. The `SeedWorld` class carries the `currentPatientId` and `currentEncounterId` between steps — state never bleeds between patients.

---

## Prerequisites

All three services must be running before executing the seed:

**1. HAPI FHIR + PostgreSQL** (Docker):
```bash
# from project root
docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

**2. Spring Boot API** (port 9090):
```bash
# from clinic-api/
./mvnw spring-boot:run        # Linux / Mac
mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run      # Windows
```

---

## Running the seed

```bash
# from care-platform/
npx nx run seed-demo-data:seed
```

Expected output on success:
```
5 scenarios (5 passed)
51 steps (51 passed)
```

An HTML report is written to `apps/seed-demo-data/reports/seed-data-report.html` after each run.

> **Idempotency**: Each run is safe to repeat. Before creating a patient, the step cascade-deletes that patient's existing observations and encounters, then re-creates everything with the same fixed ID. Practitioner and organization follow the same pattern. Running the seed twice produces identical data — no duplicates.

## Patient profiles

| Patient | DOB | Profile | Encounters | Key vitals trend |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Marcus Webb | 1965-03-12 M | Hypertensive, ongoing BP management | 4 (42, 28, 14, 3 days ago) | Systolic 158 → 138 mmHg; no SpO₂ recorded |
| Priya Nair | 1992-07-28 F | Healthy, preventive care | 2 (38, 10 days ago) | All normal; SpO₂ 99% |
| Gerald Horton | 1974-11-04 M | Overweight, sleep apnea workup + CPAP | 4 (45, 30, 15, 2 days ago) | SpO₂ 93% → 97%; weight 118 → 115 kg |
| Sandra Okafor | 1980-02-19 F | Post-cholecystectomy recovery | 4 (44, 35, 21, 7 days ago) | All vitals normalizing; weight 72 → 69 kg |
| Ramon Castillo | 1958-09-30 M | Type 2 diabetes management | 4 (40, 25, 12, 1 days ago) | BP 136/86 → 128/80; SpO₂ stable 96-97% |

The profiles are chosen to exercise a range of UI states:

- **Marcus** — no SpO₂ data; tests optional-vital handling in charts
- **Priya** — only 2 encounters; tests sparse data rendering
- **Gerald** — SpO₂ starts at 93%; tests critical/warning threshold display
- **Ages 34–68** — exercises age and gender display across the roster

## Extending the seed data

### Add a new patient

Add a new `Scenario` block to `src/features/patients.feature`. The step patterns are already defined — just fill in the data tables:

```gherkin
Scenario: Seed asthma patient — Ada Chen
  Given a patient exists with the following details:
    | id          | seed-ada-chen         |
    | firstName   | Ada                   |
    | lastName    | Chen                  |
    | dateOfBirth | 1988-04-20            |
    | gender      | female                |
    | phone       | 5551006006            |
    | email       | ada.chen@example.com  |

  When an encounter is recorded 20 days ago with reason "Asthma review" and status "finished"
  And vitals are recorded for that encounter:
    | systolicBp  | 118 |
    | diastolicBp | 75  |
    | weightKg    | 62  |
    | spo2Percent | 95  |
```

All four vital fields are optional — omit any that weren't recorded for a given visit.

### Add a new vital type to an existing encounter

Add the key to the data table for that encounter step. The keys map directly to the `VitalsRequest` fields accepted by the Spring Boot API:

| Data table key | API field | Unit |
|---|---|---|
| `systolicBp` | `systolicBp` | mmHg |
| `diastolicBp` | `diastolicBp` | mmHg |
| `weightKg` | `weightKg` | kg |
| `spo2Percent` | `spo2Percent` | % |

### Add new step patterns

If you need a step that doesn't exist yet, add it to the appropriate file in `src/step-definitions/`. Use the `function` keyword (never arrow functions) so Cucumber can bind `this` to `SeedWorld`:

```typescript
When('some new step {string}', async function(this: SeedWorld, value: string) {
  // this.currentPatientId is available here
});
```

## Technical notes

- **`@swc-node/register`** is used as the TypeScript loader (already installed in the monorepo as part of Nx). No separate `ts-node` installation is needed.
- **`module: "commonjs"`** in `tsconfig.json` overrides the monorepo base (`"esnext"`) — this is required for Cucumber's synchronous `require()` step loading to work.
- **HAPI FHIR vs Spring Boot split**: Practitioners, Organizations, and Patients are PUT directly to HAPI FHIR (port 8080) using fixed seed IDs — these resources have no Spring Boot endpoints, and fixed IDs make cascade delete reliable. Encounters and vitals go through the Spring Boot API (port 9090) as normal, with HAPI assigning their UUIDs.
- **Content-Type**: Spring Boot endpoints accept `application/json`; HAPI FHIR direct calls require `application/fhir+json`.
